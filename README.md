# Fake-News-Classification-using-Artificial-Neural-Networks-with-TensorFlow

This repository contains code and resources for classifying fake news articles using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with TensorFlow. We leverage the (WELFake) dataset, a collection of 72,134 news articles labeled as real (1) or fake (0), sourced from four popular news datasets to ensure robustness and generalization.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of the following columns:

1. Serial number: A unique identifier for each news article.
2. Title: The headline or title of the news article.
3. Text: The content of the news article.
4. Label: The label indicating whether the article is real (1) or fake (0).
